JJJ is a simple, yet powerful, personal journaling application that allows you to keep track of your thoughts, ideas, and experiences. It's built with Python and uses the power of the curses library to provide a clean, distraction-free interface right in your terminal. 

## Features

- **Autosave**: Never worry about losing your thoughts. JJJ autosaves your entries every 10 seconds.
- **Timestamps**: Each entry is automatically timestamped, so you can easily see when you wrote something.
- **Sound Effects**: Get auditory feedback with each keystroke and when your work is saved.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Saves in Dropbox**: By default, it finds your Dropbox folder and appends your journals to `journal.txt`

## Installation

To install JJJ, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. Once you have Python, you can clone this repository and install the required libraries.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/jjj.git
cd jjj
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start using JJJ, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and run:

```bash
python3 jjj
# or if you added this to your $PATH, just
jjj
```

Once the application is running, just start typing! Your entries will be saved automatically every 10 seconds, or you can manually save and exit by pressing `Ctrl+D`. If you hear a satisfying beep, then your work has most definitely been saved.
